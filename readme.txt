Block spam comments definitely without settings or Captcha.

== Description ==

"Block Spam Comment" definitely blocks comments of bots without settings or Captcha.

The three systems of "Block Spam Comment" using JavaScript make it impossible for bots to post comments, because bots cannot use JavaScript. Spam comments are not saved, so it reduces load on your server and save time to delete spam comments. 

You can see how many spam comments were blocked and data about IP and user agent of bots. You also can download the csv file with that data.
